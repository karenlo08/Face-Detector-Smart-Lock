## Inspiration
The inspiration from this project comes from my daughter Ariana. We changed our locks for smart ones because we constantly forget or lost our keys; but Ariana is not older enough to own a cellphone and be able to unlock the front door via wifi. I came up with this idea of detecting Ariana's face to unlock the door lock and apply machine learning to solve it!

The Raspberry PI will video stream and when the face recognition model detects Ariana's face will send a request to August SmartLock API to unlock it.

## Objectives
* Create an interactive demo to see machine learning in action.
* Unlock *August Smart Lock* with face detection.
* Apply computer vision on edge devices (Raspberry PI).

## Terminology
* Raspberry Pi ‚Äî It's a small, affordable computer popular with educators and robot enthusiasts ü§ñ
* Raspbian ‚Äî the Raspberry Pi Foundation‚Äôs official operating system. Raspbian is derived from Debian Linux.
* NOOBS - (New Out Of the Box Software) is a GUI operating system installation manager. It comes with Raspbian.
* OpenCV - (Open Source Computer Vision) Library to make real-time image/video processing functions like rotation, resizing and drawing frames much easier.
* Dlib face_recognition - Well documented library with face recognition algorithms, it allows the user to easily implement face detection, face recognition and even real-time face tracking from the command line.

## 1. Face Detection
A face detection system uses embedded machine learning models (Haar Cascade Classifier) and algorithms (HOG, Face Landmarks) to determine the presence and location of faces in a still image or video frame. It detects where in the image those  are situated and it places a bounding box around them.

### 1.A Haar Cascade Classifier
From OpenCV documentation:
> The word ‚ÄúCascade‚Äù in the classifier name means that the resulting classifier consists of several simpler classifiers (stages) that are applied subsequently to a region of interest until at some stage the candidate is rejected or all the stages are passed. The basic classifiers are decision-tree classifiers with at least 2 leaves. Haar-like features are the input/filters to the basic classifiers.

### 1.B Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) 
It's a feature descriptor and simplified representation that contains only the most important information about our image. It helps us identify the most prominent face features easier.

This is a excellent article where it explains very detailed how HOG works:

### 1.C Face Landmark
After we got our features descriptors from the Histogram of Oriented Gradients, we map/landmark our detected faces. Now that we know where the eyes and mouth are, we‚Äôll simply rotate, scale and shear the image so that the eyes and mouth are centered as best as possible without distorted the face. This is important for our next step.

## 2. Face Recognition

### 2.A Face Embedding and Comparing Faces
> Embedding means projecting an input into another more convenient representation space.
Doing a naive Euclidean distance measure to find similarity between faces, will generate a lot of issues because pixel intensity may vary or random noise data can be present.

<img src="/img/formula_embedding.jpg"/>

For these reasons, we can reformulate this by embedding or projecting the faces in a new equally space. The result will be a numerical vector representing 128 measurements for each face.

## 3. Connecting to August Smart Lock API

```
from august.api import Api 
from august.authenticator import Authenticator, AuthenticationState
api = Api(timeout=20)
authenticator = Authenticator(api, "phone", "YOUR_USERNAME", "YOUR_PASSWORD", access_token_cache_file="PATH_TO_ACCESS_TOKEN_CACHE_FILE")
authentication = authenticator.authenticate()
state = authentication.state
```
* If AuthenticationState is BAD_PASSWORD, that means your login_method, username and password do not match
* If AuthenticationState is AUTHENTICATED, that means you're authenticated already. If you specify "access_token_cache_file", the authentication is cached in a file. Everytime you try to authenticate again, it'll read from that file and if you're authenticated already, Authenticator won't call August again as you have a valid access_token

```
authenticator.send_verification_code()
```
* If AuthenticationState is REQUIRES_VALIDATION, then you'll need to go through verification process
* send_verification_code() will send a code to either your phone or email depending on login_method

```
# Wait for your code and pass it in to validate_verification_code()
validation_result = authenticator.validate_verification_code(123456)
```

* If ValidationResult is INVALID_VERIFICATION_CODE, then you'll need to either enter correct one or resend by calling send_verification_code() again
* If ValidationResult is VALIDATED, then you'll need to call authenticate() again to finish authentication process
```
authentication = authenticator.authenticate()
```

* Once you have authenticated and validated you can use the access token to make API calls!
```
locks = api.get_locks(authentication.access_token)
```
## 4. Unlock door when face is recognized
Creating a thread for unlocking the door will prevent our real time video processing from freezing while connecting to the Smart Lock API.
```
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
pool = ThreadPoolExecutor(1)

unlocked = False
smart_lock_instance = SmartLock()
.
.
.
#loop over frames from video and apply face recognition model
while True:
.
.
.
    if 'ariana' in names and not unlocked:
        unlocked = True
	pool.submit(smart_lock_instance.unlock())
.
.
.
```
